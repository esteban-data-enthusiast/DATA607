```

## 1. Overview

Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above. Use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears below, so that tidying and transformations can be used on the data.

<center><img src="file:///untidy_arrivals.png" style="width: 400px;height: 200px;"/></center>




```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
# Libraries to be used
library(tidyverse)
```


## 2. Read untidy data

### 2.1 Read the arrival data

Read the arrival data from your .CSV file

```{r}
src_file_path <- "C:\\tmp\\Airline_Arrival_Delays.csv"
untidy_flights <- read_csv(src_file_path)
```

### 2.2 Peak at the read data

Take a peak at the data read from the CSV file.

```{r, results=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(untidy_flights), caption = 'Table: Untidy data for flight arrivals')
```


## 3 Tidy the data

Use "tidyr" and "dplyr" as needed to tidy up and transform the data

```{r}
flights <- untidy_flights %>% 
  # remove blank lines
  drop_na() %>%
  # change format from wide to long to tidy up data
  pivot_longer(`Los Angeles`:`Seattle`, names_to = "destination", values_to = "count") %>%
    # rename column names
  rename(airline = Airline, flight_status = `Flight Status`)
```

Show a glimpse of the transformed data.

```{r, results=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(flights, 10), caption = 'Table: Tidy data for flight arrivals')
```



## 4 Perform data analysis

Perform data analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.

### 4.1 Build list of delayed flights
```{r}
delayed_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(flight_status == "delayed")
```


### 4.2 Overall delays per Airline

Which airline has the most overall delays and which one the least?

```{r}
by_airline <- delayed_flights %>%
  group_by(airline) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_count))
```

Overall, **"AM West"** airline has the **highest** number of delays compared to **"ALASKA"**, which has the **lowest**.

```{r, results=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(by_airline, caption = 'Table: Total delays per airline')
```


We can see the discrepancy between each airline's delays graphically

```{r}
ggplot(by_airline, aes(x = airline, y = total_count, fill = airline)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Overall Flight Delays Per Airline") +
  labs(x = "Airport Destinations", y = "Total Delays") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```





### 4.3 Delays per destination and airline

Which airport destinations had the most and least delays?

```{r}
by_destination <- delayed_flights %>%
  group_by(destination, airline) %>%
   summarise(total_count = sum(count)) %>%
   arrange(desc(total_count))
```


Overall, the **Phoenix** destination has **highest** number of delays (**"AM West"** airline) as well as the **lowest** number of delays (*"ALASKA"* airline).

```{r, results=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(by_destination, caption = 'Table: Total delays per destination per airline in descending order')
```


Below is the graphical representation of delays per destination in descending order.

```{r}
ggplot(by_destination, aes(x = reorder(destination, total_count), y = total_count, fill = airline)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Flight Delays Per Destination Per Airline") +
  labs(x = "Airport Destinations", y = "Total Delays")
```  

## 5. Conclusion

It was demonstrated that the packages "tidyr" and "dplyr" can be extremely useful to tidy up and transform the data.
