Project 4: Document Classification

It can be useful to be able to classify new "test" documents using already classified "training" documents.  A common example is using a corpus of labeled spam and ham (non-spam) e-mails to predict whether or not a new document is spam.  

For this project, you can start with a spam/ham dataset, then predict the class of new documents (either withheld from the training dataset or from another source such as your own spam folder).   One example corpus:   https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/

For more adventurous students, you are welcome (encouraged!) to come up with a different set of documents (including scraped web pages!?) that have already been classified (e.g. tagged), then analyze these documents to predict how new documents should be classified.

New!  Project 4 extra credit!  Students who use the relatively new tidymodels and textrecipes packages to complete their Project 4 work will automatically receive 5 extra credit points.  tidymodels is a significant improvement over Max Kuhn's older caret package.  Here are some resources to help you get up to speed on tidymodels and textrecipes.

This assignment is due end of day on Saturday.  You may work in a small team if you want.  We will look at all of your solutions in our meetup next Wednesday.
